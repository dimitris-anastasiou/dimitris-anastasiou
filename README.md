# Hi, I'm Dimitris üëã

I'm a Mechanical Engineer specializing in Mechanical Desing, Robotics and Control with hands-on experience in AI, Machine Learning, and Automation. I have worked on diverse projects ranging from predictive modeling in energy systems to quadruped robotic control, and automation processes in real-world systems. I love designing systems that integrate both hardware and software to solve complex engineering challenges. Feel free to explore my GitHub ‚Äì it‚Äôs filled with projects that might help you overcome common challenges or save time on algorithms you‚Äôd rather not reinvent. You‚Äôll also find some unique use cases that I hope inspire you. Please, have a look around and enjoy!
